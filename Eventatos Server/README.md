"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "Server=localhost;Database=EventatosDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
```
Use Trusted_Connection=True; for Windows Auth, or set User ID=...;Password=...; for SQL login.

```
"Jwt": {
  "Key": "eventatos_secret_superlong_more_than_16_chars_key",

# üìù Note from the Developer

This project was developed during a very busy academic period ‚Äî overlapping with practical exams, final project submissions, and discussions.
Because of that, testing and polishing were limited, and some features like image upload are not implemented.

However, I‚Äôve focused on building a solid backend foundation with working authentication, authorization, event management, and role-based access. I would truly appreciate your consideration of the implementation quality and the context above.

Thank you for reviewing my submission. Your feedback means a lot.
