# üìù Developer Note

Due to tight academic deadlines and ongoing final exams, the frontend was implemented using cursor. I didn't have the time to fully test it but I can confirm that authentication works. I focused my time and energy on building a solid backend architecture with authentication, authorization, event management, and booking logic.

Although the frontend is incomplete, the current structure and routing setup demonstrate my understanding client-server communication.

Thank you for your time, and I appreciate your consideration and feedback.
